# PhoneFormat

This is a copy of [albeebe/phoneformat.js](https://github.com/albeebe/phoneformat.js) with the following changes:

  * This is a [Bower](http://bower.io) package
  * Website is not a part of the repository
  * Updating is as simple as typing `make` (assuming [`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/) is installed)
  * Exposed getNumberType(country, phone) to return the type of the phone number (mobile, landline, toll free, etc.)

# Todo

  * AMD
  * Better API
